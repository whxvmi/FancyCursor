**FancyCursor** brings smooth, animated cursor effects to macOS — inspired by the legendary **Compiz cursor** from Linux.  
It’s lightweight, customizable, and works seamlessly on modern macOS versions.

## ⚙️ Permissions Notice

To function properly, **FancyCursor** requires **Accessibility access** under:

**System Settings ▸ Privacy & Security ▸ Accessibility**

This permission allows FancyCursor to draw visual effects around your cursor and track its movement.  
It **does not collect, record, or transmit any data** — all functionality is completely local.

When you launch FancyCursor for the first time, macOS will prompt you to enable this permission.  
You can safely allow it — it’s required for the app to work correctly.

## 🔒 About the Security Warning

Because **FancyCursor is not signed with an official Apple Developer ID**, macOS may display a message such as:

> “FancyCursor” can’t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.

This warning appears **for all apps that are not distributed through Apple’s Developer Program** —  
it does **not** mean the app is unsafe.

Apple shows this message automatically to any software that hasn’t been signed with a paid Developer ID.  
FancyCursor is an open-source project and does not include any malicious code or network components.

To open it safely:

1. Right-click (or Control-click) **FancyCursor.app** in Finder  
2. Choose **Open**  
3. Click **Open** again when prompted  

macOS will remember your choice after the first launch — you won’t need to do this again.

- 100% local — no tracking, telemetry, or network connections  
- No background daemons or auto-start behavior

Your privacy and control come first. ❤️
